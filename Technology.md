# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
The Pandas library in Jupyter notebook was used to clean data and perform exploratory analysis. Further analysis was completed using Python.

## Database Storage
SQLite was used to create the database.

## Machine Learning
Scikit-learn and tensorflow were the machine learning libraries used to create neural network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regressor models for regression analysis. The dataset was split into training and testing sets (95% and 5%, respectively) and feature variables were scaled. (Categorical variables were encoded prior to scaling.) 

For neural networks, both shallow and deep neural network models were tested. Parameters such as the number of inputs, neurons, and hidden layers, and the types of functions used (i.e. activation and output) were optimized for correlation between feature and target variables. Model outputs were R-squared values of the training and testing sets. These were used to assess for model accuracy and for overfitting. During training, the performance of each epoch (i.e. loss) was evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE).

## Dashboard
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages were used to create the dashboard. Bootstrap and CSS were used for styling. Interactivity was achieved by integrating D3.js and through the use of plotly charts and Leaflet maps. The dashboard is hosted on GitHub Pages.
