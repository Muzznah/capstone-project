# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas library in Jupyter notebook will be used to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
SQLite is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
Sami & Muzznah to revise this section:

sciki-learn and tensorflow are the machine learning libraries we'll be using to create neural network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regressor models for regression analysis. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets (95% and 5%, respectively) and feature variables will be scaled with encoding as needed. 

For neural networks, both shallow and deep neural network models will be trialed. Parameters such as the number of inputs, neurons, and hidden layers, and the types of functions used (i.e. activation and output) will be optimized for correlation between feature and target variables. Model outputs will be the R-squared values of the training and testing sets. These will be used to assess for model accuracy and for overfitting. During training, performance of each epoch (i.e. loss) will be evaluated using mean squared error (MSE).

## Dashboard
The dashboard will utilize JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages. Bootstrap and CSS will be used for styling. Interactivity will be achieved by integrating D3.js and through use of plotly charts and Leaflet maps. The dashboard will be hosted on GitHub Pages or Heroku.
